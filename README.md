# Intro To Quest Workshop Materials

## Items to download for the workshop    
[Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/), a friendly ftp client for transferring files to/from Quest.  Quest specific [Instructions](https://kb.northwestern.edu/quest-filetransfer) for Cyberduck can be found in the SFTP section of the transferring files page.  
  
[intro.tar](https://github.com/nuitrcs/intro_quest_workshop/raw/master/intro.tar) contains a sample submission script and a short python program used in the workshop.  We will use Cyberduck to move intro.tar from your local computer onto Quest. 
  
If you haven't already done so, PC users should download either PuTTY or FastX [Software](https://kb.northwestern.edu/quest-login) to log into Quest.  Mac users can just use the Terminal app that comes installed on their local machines.
